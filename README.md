# ðŸ¤–ML-ERC46 for Arbitrum Stylus

## Overview

Sample implementation of OpenZeppelin ERC4626 contract in Stylus using Rust which aims to enable heavy AI/ML computation for DeFi projects that want to enrich their smart vaults with machine learning capabilites that are historically performed offchain.

It provides a library with augmented ML capabilites thanks to the rustlearn crate, a machine learning package for Rust as seen in the rebalance function.
